description = """Correction of electron beam-induced sample motion is one of the major factors   
contributing to the recent resolution breakthroughs in cryo-electron microscopy.
Based on observations that the electron beam induces doming of the thin vitreous
ice layer, we developed an algorithm to correct anisotropic image motion at the 
single pixel level across the whole frame, suitable for both single particle and
tomographic images. Iterative, patch-based motion detection is combined with    
spatial and temporal constraints and dose weighting. The multi-GPU accelerated  
program, MotionCor2, is sufficiently fast to keep up with automated data        
collection. The result is an exceptionally robust strategy that can work on a   
wide range of data sets, including those very close to focus or with very short 
integration times, obviating the need for particle polishing. Application       
significantly improves Thon ring quality and 3D reconstruction resolution.     """
