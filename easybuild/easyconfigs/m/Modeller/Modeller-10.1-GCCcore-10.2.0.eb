description = """MODELLER is used for homology or comparative modeling of protein three-         
dimensional structures. The user provides an alignment of a sequence to be      
modeled with known related structures and MODELLER automatically calculates a   
model containing all non-hydrogen atoms. MODELLER implements comparative protein
structure modeling by satisfaction of spatial restraints, and can perform many  
additional tasks, including de novo modeling of loops in protein structures,    
optimization of various models of protein structure with respect to a flexibly  
defined objective function, multiple alignment of protein sequences and/or      
structures, clustering, searching of sequence databases, comparison of protein  
structures, etc."""
